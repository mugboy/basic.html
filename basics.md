# Basic HTML for kids for Visual Studio Code #

Welcome to the HTML world!

If you wanna start doing HTML, you have to make the `HTML` itself.

 Let's say we are making a toy. First we have to make the toy and then add some changes.

```html
<html> </html>
```

Then add a `head` inside the `HTML`:
```html
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
<html>
```

Now add a `title` in the `head` to make your website title. I'll name it "The nicest HTML".

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title> The nicest HTML</title>
    </head>
</html>
```
Next go to your desktop and make a new folder.

Now go back to Visual studio code in your file.

Add the `body` under the `head`.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title> The nicest HTML</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```

Now we will add a piece of text inside the `body`.

It is named `<p>` (short for *paragraph*).

I'll make the text "Hello".

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title> The nicest HTML </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p> Hello </p>
    </body>
</html>
```

Oh, I almost forgot! Next, let's build a heading.
It is useful when you are making a chapter name or title of a poem.

It is called `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, or `h6`.

The levels from 1 to 6 as you see above, are how small it is. For example, `h1` is the largest heading and `h6` is the smallest heading.

I will use `h1` for this and I will name it "Greeting".

```html
    <head>
        <title> The nicest HTML </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1> Greeting </h1>
        <p> Hello </p>
    </body>
</html>
```

Remember to always save your file with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>.
